Abstract : RADAR is an object detection system which uses Microwaves. Microwaves are nothing but the radio
waves. It uses microwaves to determine the Range, Altitude and Direction or Speed of objects. The radar dish or
antenna transmits pulses of radio pulses which returns back from any object in their path. Arduino is a single
board microcontroller. It is to make using electronics in multidisciplinary projects more accessible. This project
focus at making a Radar which is efficient, cheaper and reflects all the possible techniques that a radar consists
of.
